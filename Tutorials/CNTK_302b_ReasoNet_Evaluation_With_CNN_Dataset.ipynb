      "[1] Doc: ( @entity0 ) it was a masterful performance . i watched in awe on thursday as cardiothoracic surgeon and celebrity talk show host @entity4 surfed a gargantuan wave of criticism to shore . i should have expected that dr. @entity4 would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed \" quack treatments ... for personal financial gain . \" and thanks to the ineptitude of his critics this round , he may have actually boosted his media empire . but he 's increasingly serving himself at a cost to @entity24 and @entity25 . if dr. @entity4 was ever going to go down , surely his ship would 've sunk last summer in the wake of his disastrous testimony before a @entity30 subcommittee . he was ostensibly invited to speak as an expert witness about bogus weight loss products , but sen. @entity33 , chairwoman of the @entity30 's @entity34 , instead made him her chief example of the kind of snake oil salesmen that keep hoodwinking consumers into thinking there 's a quick fix for their expanding waistlines . @entity43 subsequently eviscerated @entity4 on his hit @entity45 show \" @entity46 . \" in a segment that 's now garnered over 6 million @entity49 views , @entity43 makes quick work of @entity4 's claims about \" magic \" green coffee beans , a product that 's now earned a $ 9 million @entity55 fine for its false marketing claims . despite his utter humiliation , dr. @entity4 soldiered on , with his university and hospital continuing to stand by him , and with @entity61 and @entity62 , who co-produce \" the dr. @entity64 , \" fully behind his program . if the @entity30 could n't bring him down , what made this particular collection of 10 doctors think they could do it with their recent letter to @entity24 , where dr. @entity4 holds a tenured professorship and administrative position in the @entity74 and performs his duties at @entity24 - affiliated @entity25 ? the doctors insisted that the university must disassociate itself from dr. @entity4 for his now well - established tendency to promote cure - alls more befitting 1915 than 2015 . turnabout is fair play . and @entity4 and his producers responded with alacrity , slicing and dicing his ill - prepared challengers with an investigative segment that would 've made \" @entity86 \" proud . he and his team score points with me for pointing out the media 's own failings in delightedly circulating the letter without looking into the backgrounds of anyone involved . it 's a simple matter to question ulterior motives when the letter itself takes pains to highlight @entity4 's critical attitude toward gmo foods , not one of his greatest indiscretions by a long shot . dr. @entity4 after all has conducted experiments on his tv audience , apparently in violation of the rules of his own academic medical center . he has a propensity to spout laughably definitive statements with little to no scientific support , such as his advice that \" every kid in @entity115 ought to be on @entity117 fatty acids and @entity118 from either the sun or a pill \" because this regimen will help them withstand concussions . instead of mounting a defense of the indefensible claims he delivers so easily and often , dr. @entity4 routed his critics by quickly pivoting to the undercurrents of their letter . he correctly pointed out that several of the letter 's signatories are @entity133 industry shills . one of the writers campaigned against a @entity136 proposition requiring @entity133 labeling , and one of the bunch even served time for felony medicaid fraud . these characters never stood a chance in tipping the scales against dr. @entity4 , but they got their headlines nonetheless . dr. @entity4 was able to transition their critique of his apparent disregard for science on his program into an easily vanquished attack on his straightforward stand for consumers ' right to accurate product labeling . when my wife first brought the letter to my attention , i immediately wanted to know whether these were @entity24 physicians . this whole affair would 've played out quite differently if a slate of credible colleagues based at his own institution were coming out against dr. oz. so far they 've made no demand for his resignation , though some colleagues made their discomfort public in an op - ed for @entity169 last week . dr. @entity4 is well - aware that some colleagues question him , discussing that tension in his @entity172 op - ed. he says he does n't expect all physicians to understand his approach to health promotion , where he 's willing to entertain just about everything , even seances . the closed , physician - only social network @entity179 issued dr. @entity4 numerous questions from its membership , none of which dr. @entity4 answered . they are revelatory of physician attitudes toward him nonetheless . one doc asked dr. @entity4 how he could keep up with the fast - changing world of cardiothoracic surgery and carry on with his show every weekday . another asked him how he knows so much about so many areas of medicine -- \" @entity193 certified n all these areas ? \" . both types of questions show the profound disconnect between most physicians , who tend not to speak unless they are certain in their expertise on a topic , and the way the media industry works . dr. @entity4 's show does n't require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day -- he has an office full of production staff behind him . let 's take it as a given that not every physician across @entity115 , or at @entity24 , has to agree with what dr. @entity4 says on his program . i certainly do n't . does he have the right to say it ? yes , but not without challenge . a real case can be made that dr. @entity4 has used his media megaphone to do harm as well as good . he is now a polarizing figure , and while @entity24 should be lauded for protecting the free speech of its academic staff , the equation with dr. @entity4 is becoming increasingly complex . he 's no longer simply good pr for the @entity24 and @entity25 , which is often featured in his show . the letter writers were correct about one thing : @entity24 's reputation is now linked with the @entity226 standing right out in front .\n",

      "[2] Doc: ( @entity1 ) @entity0 is a cornerstone event in the @entity3 faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks . it celebrates the completion of @entity8 's mission of salvation in the @entity10 and @entity11 . by dying on @entity12 , @entity8 atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on sunday , @entity8 conquered death . simple enough and reason for @entity18 to celebrate . but , like @entity19 with its tree , ornaments and @entity22 , @entity0 has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs . unlike @entity19 , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events . and that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around @entity0 ? ( no. ) here 's a journey from the @entity32 to the @entity33 , around the moon and the @entity36 's tilting axis , to @entity37 and the @entity38 to try to explain the complex holiday called @entity0 . and you 'll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool - aid . let 's start at the @entity32 . at the @entity32 , @entity44 began with @entity45 last week and culminated in @entity46 with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of @entity8 's mortal life . @entity8 rode on the back of a donkey into @entity52 on @entity45 where crowds celebrated him as the @entity55 and laid down palm branches in his path . but the crowd and the @entity59 turned on him in the course of the week , according to the @entity61 , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray @entity68 on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by @entity71 . afterward , the @entity72 took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his @entity78 address . @entity71 lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . from @entity84 to @entity85 , @entity86 to @entity87 , he expressed hope that violence would end . @entity71 also does n't put on airs . this week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the @entity61 account of a woman , a sinner , washing @entity8 ' feet and anointing them with oil . let 's move on to old @entity52 , the birthplace of @entity0 . the church of the @entity100 in old @entity52 unifies the spot where @entity8 was crucified -- @entity102 -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . on sunday , @entity105 and @entity106 @entity18 celebrated the resurrection there . in the morning , the @entity109 , the archbishop of @entity52 , entered the basilica . then mass was held followed by a procession . but a large group of indigenous @entity18 did n't join them . it 's not quite @entity0 yet in the @entity33 for @entity116 . they 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine @entity0 's date by a different calendar than @entity18 -- the @entity120 . which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of @entity46 . a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between @entity12 and @entity46 and during @entity128 . just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both @entity128 -- the @entity132 holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in @entity135 -- and @entity0 are determined by moon phases , according to @entity137 . @entity0 's timing is related to @entity128 , because @entity8 was crucified around then , according to the @entity61 . many jewish holidays , including @entity128 , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with @entity36 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- @entity128 's exact date moves around -- and so does @entity0 's . when @entity3 bishops first convened at the @entity153 in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of @entity0 , so as to fairly reliably pin it to @entity128 : it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . that 's the day in march when @entity36 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , @entity0 would be pushed down a week . confusing ? it got worse . when the @entity164 moved from the @entity120 to the gregorian calendar , @entity116 stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for @entity0 . in 1997 , the @entity167 pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . it did n't catch on . but some odd @entity0 trappings that popped up after the @entity173 very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . the bunny is an egg - laying pagan that worships the moon . that 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . @entity37 immigrants appear to have brought it to @entity185 in the 1700s . @entity37 historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . professor of medicine @entity195 described in his paper \" @entity198 ovis paschalibus , \" or \" on easter eggs , \" a custom in the @entity202 region involving a bunny and eggs , according to @entity37 public television . some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree . but @entity195 left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in @entity37 . one common idea : during @entity214 , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . by the time @entity0 rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the @entity0 eggs came from . if you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip. instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use @entity241 , @entity243 science geek @entity242 suggests . and it appears to work . just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . but be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , @entity242 warns . that 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it . happy @entity0 ! happy @entity128 !\n",
